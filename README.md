# WalrusJS

WalrusJS is a small but powerfull Javascript Framework with the a set of "must have" features for web development:

  - Data binding using the {{Mustache}} syntax (double curly braces):
  - Basic conditional and list rendering directives (`w-if`, `w-for`)
  - Directive to include HTML from an external file (`w-include`)
  - "Touch friendly" directive for click/tap event handling (`w-click`)
  - And NOTHING more!
